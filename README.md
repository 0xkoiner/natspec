# Solidity 0xff #002: The Power of Comments - Using NatSpec for Better Code Readability üìù

What do you think about the visuality of code?
In my opinion, readable, eye-catching, and well-structured code is a necessary part of development.

Imagine opening your favorite book, and the lines have inconsistent gaps, no stars to highlight key terms, or even uneven spaces between words. It would be frustrating, right?

That's exactly why I believe in the importance of NatSpec for Solidity contracts. Just like a well-structured book, NatSpec allows others to read and understand the "story" behind your smart contract. It's all about making your code easier to comprehend, especially for people who will interact with or audit it.

## Why NatSpec?

- Better clarity for developers: Helps others quickly understand the purpose and function of your code.
- Improved documentation: Allows for auto-generation of documentation that can make your contract more transparent.
- No impact on base code: While NatSpec doesn't affect the functionality, it greatly enhances maintainability and collaboration.

I'd like to share the `NatSpec format` as described in the Solidity documentation. It's a simple but powerful tool to make your code more understandable for everyone.


Let‚Äôs embrace best practices and ensure our code speaks clearly! üí¨

## Notes:
I've used clear and engaging language to explain the importance of NatSpec.
The title and structure create a smooth flow for the reader.
A call-to-action with a link to the official documentation encourages further learning.
I hope this works for you! Feel free to tweak it further if needed. üòä

Let‚Äôs embrace a shared standard and build better smart contracts together.
